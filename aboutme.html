		<p>My name is Jeremy T Cervone. I am a designer who recently graduated from the University of Connecticut with a bachelors degree in the Digital Media and Design and a concentration in Digital Game Design. Although a career in design is my current objective, I am constantly working on projects of many natures. Some such projects being the production of music which I use in many of the games I produce and co-create, making my games truely original. Aside from auditory entertainment, I very much enjoy altering and creating photos as well as creating special effects in videos. You can view many of my projects under the projects tab.
